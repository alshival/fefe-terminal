## Features
1. **Customizable personality**
   - Whether you want to be friends with your computer... or more than friends... Customize Fefe's personality using `fefe-setup personality`!

2. **Run Command-Line Commands**
   - Ask Fefe to execute commands such as `sudo apt update`, and more. She can handle various system tasks seamlessly.

3. **Interact with System Files**
   - Fefe can interact with various file types on your system, including:
     - **Images**: `.jpg`, `.png`
     - **Documents**: `.pdf`
     - **Data Files**: `.csv`, `.tsv`

4. **Search the Web**
   - Ask Fefe to search the web for you. She can find and open search results directly in your browser.

5. **Generate Images**
   - Fefe can generate images based on your prompts, adding a creative flair to your projects.

6. **Data and Financial Analysis**
   - Fefe can perform data and financial analysis. Whether itâ€™s generating visualizations from files on your system or creating stock charts using data from `yfinance`, Fefe has you covered.

## Installation

To install Fefe on your Ubuntu system:

1. Download the `.deb` package.
2. Install it using the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -i ./fefe.deb
   ```

## Setup

After installation, set up Fefe by running:

```bash
fefe-setup
```

During setup, you will be prompted to provide:

- **OpenAI API Key**: Required to access Fefe's AI capabilities.
- **OpenAI Organization ID** (Optional): Useful if you belong to an organization using OpenAI services.
- **Sudo Password** (Optional): If provided, Fefe can execute commands that require elevated privileges without prompting for your password each time.

## Usage

Ask Fefe a question using the `fefe` or `Fefe` command from your terminal. 
```bash
Fefe what are the latest headlines?
```
Note that you must escape special terminal characters with a backslash, such as `'` with `\'`.


For detailed usage instructions and customization options, run:

```bash
fefe-setup --help
```

# TO-DO
1. Add token limit check using tiktoken.
2. Give the bot the ability to pick out memories. These memories can be included during fine-tuning.

# Future Work
Fefe-Terminal provides base-line functionality expected from AI/OS integration. Fefe falls short when asked to search for content within local files. Questions like "can you find the file where I wrote about my trip to Antartica?" are difficult for Fefe to answer at the moment. There has been much development in recent years on this front. Naive RAG and GraphRAG algorithms could help provide the Ai with file context for these kinds of requests, though (especially GraphRAG) are computationally expensive and could affect response times. Still, it is worth exploring, and if vector databases are used only when such a request is made, response times should remain unaffected.

Let's say we wish to avoid GraphRAG for now and wish to implement Naive RAG for the time being. A vector database for each directory can be constructed, containing information about the content in that directory. This could improve local search by bounding the content of a vector database to a single directory. But this approach impacts global semantic search. This is the exact situation GraphRAG could come into play. But the computational cost of implementing such a solution makes it impractical for the average person. 

In the coming months, I will experiment with directory-wise vector databases for retrieval augmented generation. My idea is to construct/update a directory's vector database as needed to avoid having to schedule a process to keep each directory's vector database up-to-date If the files in a directory haven't been touched since the vector database was last updated, then proceed with RAG. If there have been changes since the vector database was constructed or the vector database does not exist, then update or create the vector database.
