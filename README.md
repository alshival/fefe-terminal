3. **Interact with System Files**
   - Fefe can interact with various file types on your system, including:
     - **Images**: `.jpg`, `.png`
     - **Documents**: `.pdf`
     - **Data Files**: `.csv`, `.tsv`

4. **Search the Web**
   - Ask Fefe to search the web for you. She can find and open search results directly in your browser.

5. **Generate Images**
   - Fefe can generate images based on your prompts, adding a creative flair to your projects.

6. **Data and Financial Analysis**
   - Fefe can perform data and financial analysis. Whether itâ€™s generating visualizations from files on your system or creating stock charts using data from `yfinance`, Fefe has you covered.

## Installation

To install Fefe on your Ubuntu system:

1. Download the `.deb` package.
2. Install it using the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -i ./fefe.deb
   ```
After installation, set up Fefe by running:

```bash
fefe-setup
```

On Windows Linux Subsystem, you will need to install the `wslu` package in order to support integration with the Windows operating system;
```
sudo apt-get install -y wslu
```

During setup, you will be prompted to provide:

- **OpenAI API Key**: Required to access Fefe's AI capabilities.
- **OpenAI Organization ID** (Optional): Useful if you belong to an organization using OpenAI services.
- **Sudo Password** (Optional): If provided, Fefe can execute commands that require elevated privileges without prompting for your password each time.

<b>A SQLite database called `.fefe.db` will be created in your home directory, `~/.fefe.db`. Upgrading Fefe to the latest version may require you to delete `~/.fefe.db`.</b>  

## Uninstalling/Reinstalling

You can uninstall the app using

```bash
sudo dpkg -r fefe
```

## Usage

Ask Fefe a question using the `fefe` or `Fefe` command from your terminal. 
```bash
Fefe what are the latest headlines?
```
Note that you must escape special terminal characters with a backslash, such as `'` with `\'`.


For detailed usage instructions and customization options, run:

```bash
fefe-setup --help
```

# TO-DO
1. Fefe struggles with directory paths when switching between directories. Need to work on improving performance here.
2. Give the bot the ability to pick out memories. These memories can be included during fine-tuning.
3. Semantic search.

# Future Work
Fefe-Terminal provides base-line functionality expected from AI/OS integration. Fefe falls short when asked to search for content within local files. Questions like "can you find the file where I wrote about my trip to Antartica?" are difficult for Fefe to answer at the moment. There has been much development in recent years on this front. Naive RAG and GraphRAG algorithms could help provide the Ai with file context for these kinds of requests, though (especially GraphRAG) are computationally expensive and could affect response times. Still, it is worth exploring, and if vector databases are used only when such a request is made, response times should remain unaffected.
